# Joke Fetcher Script

This Node.js script fetches jokes from the "icanhazdadjoke" API based on a provided search term. It then displays a random joke and saves it to a file named "jokes.txt" for future laughs.

## Usage

To use the script, run the following command in your terminal:

npm install

```bash
node script.js searchTerm <your_search_term>
